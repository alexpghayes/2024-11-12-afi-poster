Okay, finally found time to sit down with this. Looks good overall! A few mostly minor points:

- ~~In notational subsection, specify that A_{ij} encodes edge (or non-edge) between i and j.~~

- ~~Simply calling X_i "friend group" with little or no context is probably going to lead to confusion... Maybe move the DAG from the top of the second column to instead reside in the notation section, maybe even next to the table of notation?~~
    
- ~~Does this audience need lengthy text definition/explanation of the ATE, NIE, NDE? The answer could be "yes", but my sense is that you can skimp on the material currently at the bottom of column 1 if you need to buy some space.~~
    
- ~~Include department affiliations in the heading, not just university affiliations.~~
  
- You should have fewer paragraphs and more short bullets. I know you copy-pasted chunks of the paper, but other than the abstract and possibly a short conclusion, you should think of a poster as more like one giant slide than like a short version of a paper. The idea is that you are standing next to this thing and walking people through what you did, rather than people walking up and reading it on their own. That's also a reason to use more figures and such as visual aids, and rely less on words. I try to make my posters have mostly equations and images and comparatively little text. You don't have to do precisely the same, of course, but right now I think this is on the wordy side

- At the bottom of column 2, maybe just state the full theorem? Of course you can simplify things to "Under suitable assumptions on P, A, blah blah blah..."

- You probably want to include both a (short, small font, bulleted) abstract at the beginning and a brief conclusion (again, small and bulleted) at the end. Abstract can be dropped, especially with the motivating example at the beginning, but I would be sure to include a small "Future work" or similar kind of section at the end. If nothing else, it provides a nice thing to land on at the end of your "elevator pitch" when walking folks through your poster.
